SearchControllerTest
====================

An example of using UISearchController with UISearchBar's style set to UISearchBarStyleMinimal.
UISearchController is new class available in iOS8. Default presentation doesn't behave properly with all styles of UISearchBar.
When UISearchBar is set to UISearchBarStyleMinimal style, background doesn't extends upward to reach status bar. Here is little example how to 'fix' that.
